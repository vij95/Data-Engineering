# Data-Engineering
This repository consists of all my jupyter notebooks and SQL queries from my Data Engineering Class (MSCA 31012)

# Sakila queries
Sakila database schema is used for SQL queries and it can be found at:

• http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html/

• http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/

• https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-en.pdf ( Data Dictionary )

I have used pymysql library in Jupyter Notebook to query SQL database

There are 2 parts: Part B (4 questions) and Part C (5 questions) and each question has multiple sub-questions in it.
All the questions are provided in the code as comments

# Sakila DDL and DML

DDL file will create a new table fact_rental with specified columns and their concerned foreign key constraints

DML fill queries the data from sakila and sakila_snowflake database and inserts it into fact_rental table

# Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram

The EER diagram is the modeling interface and provides a visual representation of the relationships among the tables in sakila_snowflake database

# Data visualization

Tableau is used to created a dashboard for sakila dataset and it can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vijay.krishna7954/viz/Sakila_Visualization/Dashboard
