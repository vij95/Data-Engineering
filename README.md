# Data-Engineering
This repository consists of all my jupyter notebooks and SQL queries from my Data Engineering Class (MSCA 31012)

# Sakila queries
Sakila database schema is used for SQL queries and it can be found at:

• http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html/

• http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/

• https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-en.pdf ( Data Dictionary )

I have used pymysql library in Jupyter Notebook to query SQL database

There are 2 parts: Part B (4 questions) and Part C (5 questions) and each question has multiple sub-questions in it.
All the questions are provided in the code as comments
